            <p>Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate
            seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter,

            <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs
            between autumn and spring.The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs
            when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different
            dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.</p>

            <p>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding

            it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and

    <h2>Seasons of the year</h2>
    <p>Seasons are a natural phenomenon that occur as the Earth revolves around the sun. There are four distinct seasons, each lasting approximately three months: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Each season brings unique weather patterns, changes in the environment, and activities that are enjoyed by people all over the world.</p>
    <p>The first season is spring, which is typically characterized by warmer weather, longer days, and the emergence of new life in the environment. Trees and flowers start to bloom, and animals come out of hibernation or migrate back to their natural habitats. Spring is often associated with a sense of renewal and new beginnings, as people start to shake off the winter blues and enjoy the fresh air and sunshine.</p>
    <p>The second season is summer, which is the warmest and sunniest time of the year. The days are longer, and the sun is higher in the sky, providing plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities such as swimming, hiking, and picnicking. Many people take vacations during the summer months to take advantage of the beautiful weather and to explore new places. Summer is often associated with fun, relaxation, and adventure.</p>
    <p>The third season is autumn, also known as fall, which is characterized by cooler temperatures, shorter days, and the changing colors of leaves on trees. As the leaves turn from green to yellow, orange, and red, many people travel to see the beautiful foliage or go apple-picking and pumpkin-picking. Autumn is also a time for harvest festivals, Halloween, and Thanksgiving celebrations.</p>
    <p>The final season is winter, which is typically the coldest and darkest time of the year. The days are shorter, and the weather is often snowy or rainy, making it a great time for cozy indoor activities such as reading, watching movies, or spending time with family and friends. Many people enjoy winter sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and ice-skating, while others prefer to escape to warmer climates to avoid the harsh weather.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, each season brings unique experiences and opportunities to enjoy the beauty and diversity of nature. Whether it's the colorful blooms of spring, the sunny days of summer, the changing leaves of autumn, or the cozy indoor activities of winter, there is something for everyone to enjoy in every season. By appreciating and embracing the natural cycle of the seasons, we can better connect with the world around us and find joy and beauty in every moment.</p>
